# auth.md — `zeroroot-ai/gibson-tool-runner`

Auth model from the tool runner's perspective. AI-agent-facing.
Spec: `unified-identity-and-authorization` Requirements 12.1–12.3.

## What this is

The tool runner is a stateless service that authenticates to the Gibson
daemon's `gibson.component.v1.ComponentService` to register itself and
poll for work. It is one deployment per cluster (or one container per
host on customer-network installs), with **one Zitadel service account
per deployment**.

The auth model mirrors what an SDK agent does, just for tools instead
of agents. There is no special path for built-in tools.

## Files

| Concern | File |
|---|---|
| Auth wiring (env → SDK OIDC creds → daemonclient.New) | [`internal/auth/auth.go`](../internal/auth/auth.go) |
| Build guard against legacy auth | [`scripts/check-no-legacy-auth.sh`](../scripts/check-no-legacy-auth.sh) |

## Environment variables

The tool runner takes three required env vars and one optional one:

| Var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ZITADEL_TOOL_RUNNER_CLIENT_ID` | Zitadel service-account client_id (Helm Secret `gibson-zitadel-tool-runner`). |
| `ZITADEL_TOOL_RUNNER_CLIENT_SECRET` | Zitadel service-account client_secret. |
| `ZITADEL_ISSUER` | Zitadel base URL, e.g. `https://auth.zeroroot.ai`. Token URL is derived as `<ZITADEL_ISSUER>/oauth/v2/token`. |
| `GIBSON_DAEMON_ADDRESS` | gRPC address of the Envoy front-door. Defaults to `localhost:50002` when running as a sidecar; real deployments set the Envoy public URL. **Note: this env var name is preserved here for historical compatibility with the daemon-client SDK helper; it points to Envoy, not to the daemon directly.** |

[`auth.go:setOIDCEnvVars`](../internal/auth/auth.go) translates the
tool-runner-specific env vars into the SDK's generic
`OIDC_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS_*` form so `daemonclient.New` picks them up
via its credential auto-detection. Translation is idempotent — if the
generic vars are already set (e.g. in tests) they are honoured as-is.

## Connection flow

```
ConnectDaemon(ctx)
   |
   | 1. setOIDCEnvVars()
   |     - read ZITADEL_TOOL_RUNNER_CLIENT_ID/SECRET, ZITADEL_ISSUER
   |     - export OIDC_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS_CLIENT_ID/SECRET/TOKEN_URL
   |
   | 2. daemonclient.GetDaemonAddress()
   |     - reads GIBSON_DAEMON_ADDRESS (defaults to localhost:50002)
   |
   | 3. daemonclient.New(ctx, addr)
   |     - exchanges client_credentials for a Zitadel JWT (cached)
   |     - SPIFFE auto-detection via SPIFFE_ENDPOINT_SOCKET:
   |        - present + reachable: mTLS via X509-SVID
   |        - absent: server-side TLS
   |     - returns *daemonclient.Client with refreshing Bearer interceptor
   v
*daemonclient.Client
```

The tool runner's `main` calls `auth.ConnectDaemon(ctx)` once and uses
the returned client for the lifetime of the process. The harness/poll
loop is unaware of any auth concerns.

## SPIFFE auto-detection

When deployed in Kubernetes, the SPIRE Workload API socket is mounted
at `/run/spire/sockets/agent.sock`; the SDK's
[`daemonclient`](../../../core/sdk/daemonclient/) detects it
automatically and adds X509-SVID-backed TLS credentials to the dial.
The tool runner code does not reach into SPIFFE APIs directly.

For external (customer-network) deployments without SPIRE, the socket
is absent; the dial falls back to server-side TLS only. The Bearer JWT
auth path is unaffected — TLS is just edge-only instead of mutual.

## What's gone

The same legacy auth stack the rest of the polyrepo deleted is also
gone here:

| Removed | Why |
|---|---|
| `gsk_` API keys | Replaced by Zitadel client_credentials. |
| BetterAuth tokens | Audit C13. |
| HMAC identity header construction (`x-gibson-identity-mac`) | Channel security is SPIFFE mTLS / server-side TLS. |
| `TrustLocalhost` interceptor option | No bypass exists. |

`scripts/check-no-legacy-auth.sh` greps for every legacy pattern and
fails CI on a hit. Keep it green.

## Migration note (SDK >= v0.84.0)

Today the tool runner uses the SDK's `daemonclient.New` directly
because `agent.Connect` (the higher-level ADK entry point) was added
in `v0.84.0` and the tool runner has not yet bumped to consume it.
[`internal/auth/auth.go:26`](../internal/auth/auth.go) carries a
`TODO(unified-identity-and-authorization 7.1)` for the consolidation —
when the bump lands, the auth wiring shrinks to one call.

For the broader auth architecture (where tokens come from, who validates
them, how SPIFFE is configured cluster-wide), refer to the ADK's
[`auth.md`](../../adk/docs/auth.md) — the tool runner is structurally
identical, just with one Zitadel service account per deployment instead
of per agent.
